# BSTree

Implement a phonebook using Binary Search Tree (BST).

A BST is a tree in which all the nodes follow the bellow properties
1. Each node has two attributes: Key and Value, and the tree is aligned based
on the value of the Key.
2. The keys in the left subtree are smaller than its parent node’s key.
3. The keys in the right subtree are greater than its parent node’s key.
4. Duplicate keys are not allowed. So, if there is already the node with the key in the tree, only the value of the node should be replaced by the new value.
